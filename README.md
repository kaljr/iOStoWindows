# iOStoWindows
Connect an iOS device to a Windows client using usbmuxd (tcp)

## Windows Requirements
- `usbmuxd` must be installed (can be done by installing iTunes)
- client must "use" `tcp` to connect (can be done with [libimobiledevice](https://github.com/libimobiledevice-win32/imobiledevice-net))
